# 💫 About Me:
A passionate entry-level *Java* and React developer from Mysuru, building full-stack web applications with clean, responsive UIs and solid backend logic. I enjoy taking projects from idea to deployment, working with Java, SQL, React, Tailwind, and PostgreSQL, and deploying them on platforms like Vercel and Render.<br><br>I have built projects like an Inventory Management System, a Bank Management System, an IMDB-style movie app, and weather and ML-based gesture recognition apps, which helped me strengthen my problem-solving and API integration skills. Alongside development, I bring UI/UX design experience from a remote internship at Rablo, where I worked with Figma to create intuitive web and mobile interfaces.<br><br>I completed my BCA with a 9.2 CGPA and continuously upskill through certifications in AI, JavaScript, React, and UX design. I am comfortable working in collaborative, fast-paced environments, backed by leadership and discipline gained as an NCC Sergeant, and I am eager to contribute to real-world products as a junior full stack developer.
